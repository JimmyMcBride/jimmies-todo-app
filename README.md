# Jimmies Todo App

## Install

`npm i -g jimmies-todo-app`

## Run

`todo`

## Important

You must be able to use postgres from command line
to use. I tried with sqlite3 but the sqlite3
dependency was bugging out on install via npm so I
switched to postgres.

If you want to use postgres from your terminal on
windows, follow the last three steps in
[this guide](https://jimmymcbride.now.sh/blog/windows-psql-intsall)!
